## Installation

3DSpineMS is built in Matlab&reg;. It requires Matlab 8.4 (R2014b) or superior.

The library installation consists in decompressing or copying library folder (3DSpineMS) to any place, for example: `C:/matlab/mylibraries/3DSpineMS`

Adding that folder and subfolders to Matlab path is useful for using the tools provided and their documentation. This can be done with matlab built-in functions `addpath` and `genpath`. For example:

```
addpath(genpath('C:/matlab/mylibraries/3DSpineMS'));
```

### Using library matlab documentation

Once the library has been added to the path, its documentation can be browsed through `doc` command. This will open the homepage of Matlab help where many shortcuts of different installed toolboxes are shown. This library is recognised by Matlab as Supplemental Software and its documentation can be accesed through the 3DSpineMS Toolbox link inside Supplemental Software box.

```
