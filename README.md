### Using toolbox matlab documentation

Once the toolbox has been installed, its documentation can be browsed through `doc` command. This will open the homepage of Matlab help where many shortcuts of different installed toolboxes are shown. This toolbox is recognised by Matlab as Supplemental Software and its documentation can be accesed through the 3DSpineMFE Toolbox link inside Supplemental Software box.
